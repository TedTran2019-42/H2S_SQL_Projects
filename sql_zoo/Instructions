Instructions 
-------------
1. sh ./import_db.sh to initialize or reset the database
2. Fill in the required SQL in lib/ files 
3. Use 'bundle exec rspec' to utilize all specs, bundle exec rspec spec/spec_name_spec.rb to run specs for one file
4. Run "psql" then insert your queries if you wish to test them manually.

Suggested Workflow: 
-------------------
0. Unless you enjoy working with vim, I'd suggest working with your code editor of choice on the host computer then using 
docker cp to put files into the container for testing. (This will be a massive pain and hassle, though. Learn how to use vim)
Optional: How would you edit the Dockerfile to use your preferred text editor within the container? 
1. Write the query on host computer 
2. Transfer result into docker container 
3. Test result 
4. Rinse and repeat until all specs are green! 

Notes
-------
1. The tables in this dataset come from a third party.
2. Helpful options for vim: :set number and :color on-- you should put these into a ~/.vimrc file. (~ in container is root)
